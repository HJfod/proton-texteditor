# Proton
Simple text editor made using Electron, jQuery and FileReader.

Name was chosen on the basis that it's built with Electron, I'm working on an another app named Neutron and Proton is just a sick ass name overall.

# Installation
Download Proton-win32-ia32.zip from releases/v1.0, unzip it and run Proton.exe to use the program.
